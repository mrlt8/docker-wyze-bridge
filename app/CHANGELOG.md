- WEB-UI: `/photo/<cam-name>.jpg` endpoint to take a photo on the camera sensor and return it.
- WEB-UI: Display additional `camera_info` from the current session. #436
- MQTT: `/takePhoto` endpoint to take a photo on the camera sensor.
- MQTT: `/motion` endpoint that updates when a new file is detected in the alarm folder on the camera's SD card. Requires `PULL_ALARM` to be enabled.
