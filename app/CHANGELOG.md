## Changes in v1.2.1

- ðŸ’¥ Breaking: `MAX_NOREADY` and `MAX_BADRES` are being replaced with the time-based `RTSP_READTIMEOUT`.
- âœ¨ New: ENV option `CONNECT_TIMEOUT` - Force the stream to timeout and close if if can't connect to the cam. Potential fix for #306 and #211 where a stream would get stuck trying to connect until the bridge restarted.

- âœ¨ New: ENV option `FORCE_FPS_NAME` - camera-specific option to force the camera to use a different FPS. Can be used to correct slow/fast SD/cloud recordings.
- ðŸ”¨ Fixed: Auth issue when using WEBRTC.
- ðŸš§ Changed: Additional tweaks to prevent memory leaks.
- ðŸš§ Changed: Default `RTSP_READTIMEOUT` has been reduced to 20s.
- ðŸŽ¨ Logging: Stream will now display the fps that the camera is using.
