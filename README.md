Some reports of issues with v1 and WCO models that need further investigation.

### Firmware Compatibility

The bridge currently has issues connecting to cameras on newer firmware with DTLS enabled.

If you wish to continue using your camera with the bridge, you should downgrade or remain on a firmware without DTLS:
| Camera | Latest Firmware w/o DTLS    |
| ------ | --------------------------- |
| V2     | 4.9.6.241 (March 9, 2021)   |
| V3     | 4.36.3.19 (August 26, 2021) |
| PAN    | 4.10.6.241 (March 9, 2021)  |

## Basic Usage

### docker run

Use your Wyze credentials and run:

```bash
docker run -p 8888:8888 -e WYZE_EMAIL= -e WYZE_PASSWORD=  mrlt8/wyze-bridge:latest
```

This will start the bridge with the HLS ports open and you can view your stream by visiting: `http://localhost:8888/cam-nickname` where localhost is the hostname or ip of the machine running the bridge followed by the cam nickname in lowercase with `-` in place of spaces.

### docker-compose (recommended)

This is similar to the docker run command, but will save all your options in a yaml file.

1. [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrlt8/docker-wyze-bridge/main/docker-compose.sample.yml) and rename or create a `docker-compose.yml` file
2. Edit `docker-compose.yml` with your wyze credentials
3. run `docker-compose up`

Once you're happy with your config you can use `docker-compose up -d` to run it in detached mode.

### üè† Home Assistant

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmrlt8%2Fdocker-wyze-bridge)

#### Special Characters

If your email or password contains a `%` or `$` character, you may need to escape them with an extra character. e.g., `pa$$word` should be entered as `pa$$$$word`

## Camera Stream URIs

By default, the bridge will create three streams for each of your cameras which can be acccessed at the following URIs, where `camera-nickname` is the name of the camera set in the Wyze app and converted to lower case with hyphens in place of spaces. e.g. 'Front Door' would be `/front-door`

Replace localhost with the hostname or ip of the machine running the bridge:

- RTMP:

  ```
  rtmp://localhost:1935/camera-nickname
  ```

- RTSP:

  ```
  rtsp://localhost:8554/camera-nickname
  ```

- HLS:

  ```
  http://localhost:8888/camera-nickname/stream.m3u8
  ```

- HLS can also be viewed in the browser using:

  ```
  http://localhost:8888/camera-nickname
  ```

### Multi-Factor Authentication

Two-factor authentication ("Two-Step Verification" in the wyze app) is supported and will automatically be detected, however additional steps are required to enter your verification code.

- Echo the verification code directly to `/tokens/mfa_token` by opening a second terminal window and using:

  ```bash
  docker exec -it wyze-bridge sh -c 'echo "123456" > /tokens/mfa_token'
  ```

- Mount `/tokens/` locally and add your verification code to a file named `mfa_token`:

  ```YAML
  volumes:
      - ./tokens:/tokens/
  ```

- üè† Home Assistant:

  Add your code to the text file: `/config/wyze-bridge/mfa_token.txt`.

## ARM/Raspberry Pi

The default `docker-compose.yml` will pull a multi-arch image that has support for both amrv7 and arm64, and no changes are required to run the container as is.

### libseccomp2

arm/arm64 users on 32-bit Debian-based distros may experience errors such as `can't initialize time` which can be resolved by updating libseccomp2:

```bash
apt-get -y install libseccomp2/unstable
```

or

```bash
wget http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/libs/libseccomp/libseccomp2_2.5.1-1_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i libseccomp2_2.5.1-1_armhf.deb
```

### Build from source

If you would like to build the container from source, you will need to edit your `docker-compose.yml` to use the arm libraries by removing or commenting out the line `image: mrlt8/wyze-bridge:latest` and add or uncomment the following three lines:

```YAML
build:
    context: ./app
    dockerfile: Dockerfile.arm
```

## Advanced Options

**WYZE_EMAIL** and **WYZE_PASSWORD** are the only two required environment variables. The following envs are optional.

### Filtering

The default option will automatically create a stream for all the cameras on your account, but you can use the following environment options in your `docker-compose.yml` to filter the cameras.

All options are case-insensitivE, and take single or comma separated values.

#### Examples

- Whitelist by Camera Name (set in the wyze app):

  ```yaml
  environment:
      ..
      - FILTER_NAMES=Front Door, Driveway, porch cam
  ```

- Whitelist by Camera MAC Address:

  ```yaml
  - FILTER_MACS=00:aA:22:33:44:55, Aa22334455bB
  ```

- Whitelist by Camera Model:

  ```yaml
  - FILTER_MODEL=WYZEC1-JZ
  ```

- Whitelist by Camera Model Name:

  ```yaml
  - FILTER_MODEL=V2, v3, Pan
  ```

- Blacklisting:

  You can reverse any of these whitelists into blacklists by setting `FILTER_BLOCK`.

  ```yaml
  environment:
      ..
      - FILTER_NAMES=Bedroom
      - FILTER_BLOCK=true
  ```

### LAN Mode

Like the wyze app, the tutk library will attempt to stream directly from the camera when on the same LAN as the camera in "LAN mode" or relay the stream via the cloud in "relay mode".

LAN mode is more ideal as all streaming will be local and won't use additional bandwidth.

You can restrict streaming to LAN only by adding the `LAN_ONLY` environment variable:

```yaml
environment:
    ..
    - LAN_ONLY=True
```

### Snapshot/Still Images

- `SNAPSHOT=API` Will run ONCE at startup and will grab a *high-quality* thumbnail from the wyze api and save it to `/img/cam-name.jpg` on docker installs or `/config/www/cam-name.jpg` in Home Assistant mode.

- `SNAPSHOT=RTSP` Will run every 180 seconds (configurable) and wll grab a new frame from the RTSP stream every iteration and save it to `/img/cam-name.jpg` on standard docker installs or `/config/www/cam-name.jpg` in Home Assistant mode. Can specify a custom interval with `SNAPSHOT=RTSP(INT)` e.g. `SNAPSHOT=RTSP30` to run every 30 seconds

### MQTT (beta)

Some basic MQTT support is now available in v0.7.0.

MQTT auth and discovery should be automatic in Home Assistant mode - can be disabled by setting `MQTT_HOST` to False.

| ENV Name    | Description                                   | Example             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| MQTT_HOST   | IP/Hostname AND Port of the MQTT broker       | core-mosquitto:1883 |
| MQTT_AUTH   | Username AND password; leave blank if none    | user:pass           |
| MQTT_TOPIC  | Optional - Specify topic prefix               | myhome              |
| MQTT_DTOPIC | Optional - Discovery topic for home assistant | homeassistant       |

### Bitrate and Resolution

Bitrate and resolution of the stream from the wyze camera can be adjusted with:

```yaml
environment:
    - QUALITY=HD120
```

Additional info:

- Resolution can be set to `SD` (360p in the app) or `HD` - 640x360/1920x1080 for cams or 480x640/1296x1728 for doorbells.
- Bitrate can be set from 30 to 255. Some bitrates may not work with certain resolutions.
- Bitrate and resolution changes will apply to ALL cameras.
- Adjusting the bitrate and resolution in the bridge will also change the stream in the wyze app and vice versa.
- App equivalents would be:
  - 360p - SD30
  - SD - HD60
  - HD - HD120

### Custom FFmpeg Commands

You can pass a custom [command](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html) to FFmpeg by using `FFMPEG_CMD` in your docker-compose.yml:

#### For all cameras

```YAML
environment:
    ..
    - FFMPEG_CMD=-f h264 -i - -vcodec copy -f flv rtmp://rtsp-server:1935/
```

#### For a specific camera

where `CAM_NAME` is the camera name in UPPERCASE and `_` in place of spaces and hyphens:

```yaml
- FFMPEG_CMD_CAM_NAME=ffmpeg -f h264 -i - -vcodec copy -f flv rtmp://rtsp-server:1935/
```

Additional info:

- The `ffmpeg` command is implied and is optional.
- The camera name will automatically be appended to the end of the command.

### Custom FFmpeg Flags

Custom ffmpeg flags can easily be tested with:

```YAML
environment:
    ..
    - FFMPEG_FLAGS=-fflags +flush_packets+genpts+discardcorrupt+nobuffer
```

or where `CAM_NAME` is the camera name in UPPERCASE and `_` in place of spaces and hyphens:

```yaml
- FFMPEG_FLAGS_CAM_NAME=-flags low_delay
```

### rtsp-simple-server

[rtsp-simple-server](https://github.com/aler9/rtsp-simple-server/blob/main/rtsp-simple-server.yml) options can be customized as an environment variable in your docker-compose.yml by prefixing `RTSP_` to the UPPERCASE parameter.

e.g. use `- RTSP_RTSPADDRESS=:8555` to overwrite the default `rtspAddress`.

or `- RTSP_PATHS_ALL_READUSER=123` to customize a path specific option like `paths: all: readuser:123`

### Debugging options

environment options:

- `URI_SEPARATOR` (-|_|#) Customize the separator used to replace spaces in the URI; available values are `-`, `_`, or use `#` to remove spaces.

- `IGNORE_OFFLINE` (string/bool) Ignore ofline cameras until container restarts

- `OFFLINE_TIME` (int) Customize the sleep time when a camera is offline

- `DEBUG_FRAMES` (string/bool) Show all lost/incomplete frames

- `DEBUG_LEVEL` (debug|info|warning|error) Adjust the level of upstream logging

- `RTSP_LOGLEVEL` (debug|info|warn) Adjust the verbosity of rtsp-simple-server; available values are "warn", "info", "debug".

- `DEBUG_FFMPEG` (string/bool) Enable additional logging from FFmpeg

- `FRESH_DATA` (string/bool) Remove local cache and pull new data from wyze servers.
