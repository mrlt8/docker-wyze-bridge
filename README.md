Docker container to expose a local RTMP, RTSP, and HLS or Low-Latency HLS stream for ALL your Wyze cameras including the outdoor and doorbell cams. No third-party or special firmware required.

It just works!

Local cameras stream locally without additional bandwidth.

Now with a Web-UI - view all your cameras in one place!

Based on [@noelhibbard's script](https://gist.github.com/noelhibbard/03703f551298c6460f2fd0bfdbc328bd#file-readme-md) with [kroo/wyzecam](https://github.com/kroo/wyzecam) and [aler9/rtsp-simple-server](https://github.com/aler9/rtsp-simple-server).

Please consider starring or [sponsoring](https://ko-fi.com/mrlt8) this project if you found it useful.

## Quick Start

Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and use your Wyze credentials to run:

```bash
docker run \
  -e WYZE_EMAIL=you@email.com \
  -e WYZE_PASSWORD=yourpassw0rd \
  -p 1935:1935 -p 8554:8554 -p 8888:8888 -p 5000:5000 \
  mrlt8/wyze-bridge:latest
```

You can then use the web interface at `http://localhost:5000` where localhost is the hostname or ip of the machine running the bridge.

See [basic usage](#basic-usage) for additional information.

## What's Changed in v1.8.12

  - Fixed: Local recording creating zero byte files when audio codec was not supported by the mp4 container. #575 Thanks @pldimarco!
    - Note: Bridge wil use the `mov` container if using the raw PCM from camera. Please usee `AUDIO_CODEC=aac` if you require an mp4.
  - New: Show camera status and name in fullscreen WebUI. 
  - New: Optional autoplay in WebUI - Requires autoplay support in the browser. #574 Thanks @JA16122000!
  - New: Query params for web-ui:
    - autoplay `http://localhost:5000/?autoplay`
  - Updated: rtsp-simple-server to v0.20.1
  - Updated: iOS Version

Should work on most x64 systems as well as on some arm-based systems like the Raspberry Pi.

The container can be run on its own, in [Portainer](https://github.com/mrlt8/docker-wyze-bridge/wiki/Portainer), [Unraid](https://github.com/mrlt8/docker-wyze-bridge/issues/236), as a [Home Assistant Add-on](https://github.com/mrlt8/docker-wyze-bridge/wiki/Home-Assistant), locally or remotely in the cloud.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmrlt8%2Fdocker-wyze-bridge)

## Basic Usage

### docker-compose (recommended)

This is similar to the docker run command, but will save all your options in a yaml file.

1. Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
2. Use the [sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrlt8/docker-wyze-bridge/main/docker-compose.sample.yml) as a guide to create a `docker-compose.yml` file with your wyze credentials.
3. Run `docker-compose up`.

Once you're happy with your config you can use `docker-compose up -d` to run it in detached mode.

#### Updating your container

To update your container, `cd` into the directory where your `docker-compose.yml` is located and run:

```bash
docker-compose pull # Pull new image
docker-compose up -d # Restart container in detached mode
docker image prune # Remove old images
```

#### Special Characters

If your email or password contains a `%` or `$` character, you may need to escape them with an extra character. e.g., `pa$$word` should be entered as `pa$$$$word`

#### Web-UI

The bridge features a basic Web-UI which can display a preview of all your cameras as well as direct links to all the video streams.

The web-ui can be accessed on the default port `5000`:

```text
http://localhost:5000/
```

Snapshots for each camera are accessible using the URI:

```text
http://localhost:5000/img/camera-nickname.jpg
```

New snapshots can also be generated on demand using the URI:

```text
http://localhost:5000/snapshot/camera-nickname.jpg
```

If you're running the WebUI behind a reverse-proxy or need to change the hostname and/or port for each stream, you can do so by passing the needed ENVs:

```yaml
environment:
  - WB_RTSP_URL=rtsp://my-hostname-or-ip:1234/
  - WB_RTMP_URL=rtmp://my-hostname-or-ip:5678/
  - WB_HLS_URL=http://my-hostname-or-ip:9090/
```
Query params to adjust web-ui:

    - Fullscreen/kiosk mode `http://localhost:5000/?fullscreen`
    - Number of columns `http://localhost:5000/?columns=4`
    - Preview refresh interval `http://localhost:5000/?refresh=60`
    - Camera order `http://localhost:5000/?order=front-cam,back-cam,garage,other`
    - autoplay `http://localhost:5000/?autoplay`

NOTE: You can combine multiple queries into a single request:
```text
http://localhost:5000/?fullscreen&autoplay&columns=2&refresh=0&order=front,side
```

#### Camera Stream URIs

By default, the bridge will create three streams for each of your cameras which can be accessed at the following URIs, where `camera-nickname` is the name of the camera set in the Wyze app and converted to lower case with hyphens in place of spaces. e.g. 'Front Door' would be `/front-door`

Replace localhost with the hostname or ip of the machine running the bridge:

```text
rtmp://localhost:1935/camera-nickname

rtsp://localhost:8554/camera-nickname

http://localhost:8888/camera-nickname/stream.m3u8
  ```

- HLS can also be viewed in the browser using:

  ```text
  http://localhost:8888/camera-nickname
  ```

- Low-Latency HLS (enable with `LLHLS=true`):

  ```text
  https://localhost:8888/camera-nickname
  or
  https://localhost:8888/camera-nickname/stream.m3u8
  ```

## API Endpoints

In addition to the WebUI, you can also access the internal json API with the camera status/details:

```text
http://localhost:5000/api
http://localhost:5000/api/<camera-name>
http://localhost:5000/api/<camera-name>/status
```

Submit a Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) code:
```text
http://localhost:5000/mfa/<123456>
```

On-demand controls:

```text
http://localhost:5000/api/<camera-name>/start
http://localhost:5000/api/<camera-name>/stop
```

Server Sent Event with status for all cameras:

```text
http://localhost:5000/api/sse_status
```

## Advanced Options

**WYZE_EMAIL** and **WYZE_PASSWORD** are the only two required environment variables.

**The following envs are all optional.**

### On-Demand Streaming

NOTE: on-demand settings will be ignred if local recording is enabled for a particular camera.

The bridge will always attempt to connect and maintain an active connection to each of the non-battery powered cameras, however, you can change this default behavior to only connect to the cameras when needed by setting the ENV:

```yaml
  environment:
    - ON_DEMAND=True
```

### Audio

Audio is disabled by default and must be enabled in the ENV.

#### Enable audio

- For all cameras:

  ```YAML
  environment:
      ..
      - ENABLE_AUDIO=True
  ```

- For a specific camera:

  where `CAM_NAME` is the camera name in UPPERCASE and `_` in place of spaces and hyphens:

  ```yaml
    - ENABLE_AUDIO_CAM_NAME=True
    - ENABLE_AUDIO_OTHER_CAM=True
  ```

  üè† Home Assistant - Use `CAM_OPTIONS` and add a new entry for each camera:
  
  ```yaml
  - CAM_NAME: Cam Name
    AUDIO: true
  - CAM_NAME: other cam
    AUDIO: true
  ```

#### Audio output codec

By default, the bridge will attempt to copy the audio from the camera without re-encoding *unless* the camera is using a codec that isn't supported by RTSP, in which case the audio will be converted to AAC.

The `AUDIO_CODEC` ENV can be used should you need to re-encode the audio to another format for compatibility:

```yaml
  - AUDIO_CODEC=AAC
```

#### Audio filtering

Custom ffmpeg audio filters can be set with `AUDIO_FILTER`, but please note that audio filters will only be applied if re-encoding to another codec.

```yaml
  - AUDIO_FILTER=highpass=f=300,lowpass=f=2500,volume=volume=2
```

### Filtering

The default option will automatically create a stream for all the cameras on your account, but you can use the following environment options in your `docker-compose.yml` to filter the cameras.

All options are case-insensitivE, and take single or comma separated values.

#### Examples

- Whitelist by Camera Name (set in the wyze app):

  ```yaml
  environment:
      ..
      - FILTER_NAMES=Front Door, Driveway, porch cam
  ```

- Whitelist by Camera MAC Address:

  ```yaml
  - FILTER_MACS=00:aA:22:33:44:55, Aa22334455bB
  ```

- Whitelist by Camera Model:

  ```yaml
  - FILTER_MODELS=WYZEC1-JZ
  ```

- Whitelist by Camera Model Name:

  ```yaml
  - FILTER_MODELS=V2, v3, Pan
  ```

- Blacklisting:

  You can reverse any of these whitelists into blacklists by setting `FILTER_BLOCK`.

  ```yaml
  environment:
      ..
      - FILTER_NAMES=Bedroom
      - FILTER_BLOCK=true
  ```

### Network Connection Modes

Like the wyze app, the tutk library has three different modes to connect to the camera and will attempt to stream directly from the camera when on the same LAN as the camera in "LAN mode". If the camera is not available locally, it will either attempt to stream directly from your network using "P2P Mode" or relay the stream via the wyze servers (AWS) in "relay mode".

LAN mode is more ideal as all streaming will be local and won't use additional bandwidth.

#### LAN Mode

By default, the bridge will attempt to connect via "LAN Mode", but will fallback to other methods if LAN mode fails.
You can restrict streaming to LAN only by setting the `NET_MODE=LAN` environment variable:

```yaml
environment:
    ..
    - NET_MODE=LAN
```

#### P2P Mode

`NET_MODE=P2P` is ideal when running the bridge remotely on a different network or on a VPS and will allow the bridge to stream directly from the camera over the internet while blocking "Relay Mode".

#### ANY Mode

`NET_MODE=ANY` is the equivalent to leaving `NET_MODE` unset and will allow the connection to fallback to P2P or relay mode.

#### `NET_MODE` for a specific camera

In the event that you need to allow the bridge to access a select number of cameras outside of your LAN, you can specify them by appending the camera name to `NET_MODE`, where `CAM_NAME` is the camera name in UPPERCASE and `_` in place of spaces and hyphens:

```yaml
    ..
    - NET_MODE=LAN
    - NET_MODE_CAM_NAME=P2P
```

  üè† Home Assistant - Use `CAM_OPTIONS` and add a new entry for each camera:
  
  ```yaml
  - CAM_NAME: Cam Name
    NET_MODE: P2P
  ```

### Proxy stream from RTSP firmware

**For cameras on official RTSP FW (4.19.x, 4.20.x, 4.28.x, 4.29.x, 4.61.x.) only.**

The bridge can pull the credentials from the camera and proxy the stream over the bridge.

The secondary stream will be available with the `fw` suffix e.g., `cam-namefw`.

```yaml
# Add cameras that have RTSP enabled in the app:
RTSP_FW=true
# or use force to turn on the rtsp stream:
RTSP_FW=force
```
### Snapshot/Still Images

**See [web-ui](#web-ui) to pull snapshots on-demand.**

- `SNAPSHOT=API` Will run ONCE at startup and will grab a *high-quality* thumbnail from the wyze api and save it to `/img/cam-name.jpg` on docker installs or `/config/www/cam-name.jpg` in Home Assistant mode.

- `SNAPSHOT=RTSP` Will run every 180 seconds (configurable) and wll grab a new frame from the RTSP stream every iteration and save it to `/img/cam-name.jpg` on standard docker installs or `/config/www/cam-name.jpg` in Home Assistant mode. Can specify a custom interval with `SNAPSHOT=RTSP(INT)` e.g. `SNAPSHOT=RTSP30` to run every 30 seconds

- `IMG_DIR=/img/` Specify the directory where the snapshots will be saved *within the container*. Use volumes in docker to map to an external directory.

- `IMG_TYPE` Specify the file type of the image, e.g. `IMG_TYPE=png`. Will default to jpg.

### Boa HTTP Server

NOTE: It appears that Boa has been disabled/removed in modern versions of the wyze firmware.

Some wyze cams have have a built-in http server "boa" that is enabled when downloading a time lapse from the camera. By enabling this http server, we can have full local access to the SD card on the camera, so you can download whatever you need off the SD card without having to take each camera down.

#### Enable Boa

**SD Card and local connection REQUIRED.**

This will enable the boa server on each camera `http://<cam-ip>:80/` that has the boa server and has an SD card in the camera.
PLEASE NOTE: If enabled, anyone on your local network will be able to access/download stuff from the SD Card on the camera.
  
```yaml
environment:
    ..
    - ENABLE_BOA=true
```

#### Boa Interval

The boa server will go down after some time and needs to be restarted from time to time. This interval will keep the server up and pull any new images at the same time.

This will default to 5 if not set.

```yaml
    - ENABLE_BOA=true
    - BOA_INTERVAL=30
```

#### Take Photo

**SD Card and local connection REQUIRED.**

This will take a high quality photo on the camera on each `BOA_INTERVAL`.

```yaml
    - ENABLE_BOA=true
    - TAKE_PHOTO=true
```

Photos can also be taken on-demand by publishing to the MQTT topic `wyzebridge/<camera-name>/takePhoto`.

#### Pull Photo

**SD Card and local connection REQUIRED.**

This will pull the latest photo from the camera on each `BOA_INTERVAL`.

Files will be saved to your local img_dir as `cam-name_YYYMMDD_HH_MM_SS.jpg` or `cam-name.jpg` if `TAKE_PHOTO` is enabled.

```yaml
    - ENABLE_BOA=true
    - PULL_PHOTO=true
```

#### Pull Alarm

**SD Card and local connection REQUIRED.**

In addition to pulling the latest alarm image from the camera on each `BOA_INTERVAL`, this will also trigger a motion event to the MQTT topic `wyzebridge/<camera-name>/motion` if available.

Files will be saved to your local img_dir as `cam-name_alarm.jpg`.

```yaml
    - ENABLE_BOA=true
    - PULL_PHOTO=true
```

#### Motion Alerts

**SD Card and local connection REQUIRED.**

If the MQTT options are configured and enabled, motion events will be sent to the MQTT topic `wyzebridge/<camera-name>/motion`.

Motion alerts can also be sent via Webhook/HTTP to any url by specifying the url and using the variable `{cam_name}`:

```yaml
    - ENABLE_BOA=true
    - MOTION_HTTP=http://localhost/triggerMotion?cam={cam_name}
```

#### Motion Cooldown

The number of seconds to keep the motion flag set to true in MQTT before it gets cleared or resending another HTTP/webhook event.

This will default to 10 if not set.

```yaml
    - ENABLE_BOA=true
    - MOTION_COOLDOWN=30
```

### Stream Recording

The bridge can be configured to record all or select camera streams to the container which can be mapped to a local directory.

#### Enable recording

```yaml
environment:
...
  - TZ=America/New_York
  - RECORD_ALL=True
volumes:
  - /local/path/:/record/
```

Or to specify select cameras, where `CAM_NAME` is the camera name in UPPERCASE and `_` in place of spaces and hyphens:

```yaml
  - RECORD_CAM_NAME=True
  - RECORD_OTHER_CAM=True
```

üè† Home Assistant - Use `CAM_OPTIONS` and add a new entry for each camera:

```yaml
- CAM_NAME: Cam Name
  RECORD: true
- CAM_NAME: Other cam
  RECORD: true
```

See the [Stream Recording wiki page](https://github.com/mrlt8/docker-wyze-bridge/wiki/Stream-Recording#recording-configuration) page for additional options.

### Offline camera IFTTT webhook (BETA)

This option can send a trigger to [IFTTT's webhooks integration](https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks) when the camera is detected as being offline (-90).

Note:This is still experimental as the connection will sometimes just timeout a number of times before going "offline".

```yaml
  - OFFLINE_IFTTT=MyEventName:my_IFTTT_Webhooks_Key
```

The bridge should then trigger your event with the following values:

```json
{
  "value1" : "cam-name", // camera name
  "value2" : -90, // error no
  "value3" : "IOTC_ER_DEVICE_OFFLINE" // error name
}

### Livestream

Basic livestream support is available for YouTube and Facebook, but you can also specify any custom rtmp server for other services like Twitch.

To use this feature, set a new env in your docker-compose.yml with the service (`YOUTUBE_` or `FACEBOOK_`) prefix followed by the camera name in UPPERCASE with `_` in place of spaces and hyphens, and set your stream key as the value. Custom rtmp servers can be specified using the `LIVESTREAM_` prefix:

```yaml
  - YOUTUBE_FRONT_DOOR=MY-STREAM-KEY
  - FACEBOOK_OTHER_CAM=MY-STREAM-KEY
  # twitch example:
  - LIVESTREAM_CAM_NAME=rtmp://jfk.contribute.live-video.net/app/MY-STREAM-KEY
```

üè† Home Assistant - Use `CAM_OPTIONS` and add a new entry for each camera:

```yaml
- CAM_NAME: Cam Name
  LIVESTREAM: rtmp://jfk.contribute.live-video.net/app/MY-STREAM-KEY
- CAM_NAME: other cam
  LIVESTREAM: rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2/my-youtube-key
```

### MQTT (beta)

Some basic MQTT support is now available in v0.7.0.

MQTT auth and discovery should be automatic in Home Assistant mode - can be disabled by setting `MQTT_HOST` to False.

| ENV Name    | Description                                   | Example             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| MQTT_HOST   | IP/Hostname AND Port of the MQTT broker       | core-mosquitto:1883 |
| MQTT_AUTH   | Username AND password; leave blank if none    | user:pass           |
| MQTT_TOPIC  | Optional - Specify topic prefix               | myhome              |
| MQTT_DTOPIC | Optional - Discovery topic for home assistant | homeassistant       |

### Bitrate and Resolution

Bitrate and resolution of the stream from the wyze camera can be adjusted with:

#### Set quality for all cameras

```yaml
environment:
    - QUALITY=HD120
```

#### Set quality for single camera

where `CAM_NAME` is the camera name in UPPERCASE and `_` in place of spaces and hyphens:

```yaml
environment:
    - QUALITY_CAM_NAME=HD120
```

Additional info:

- Resolution can be set to `SD` (360p in the app) or `HD` - 640x360/1920x1080 for cams or 480x640/1296x1728 for doorbells.
- Bitrate can be set from 30 to 255. Some bitrates may not work with certain resolutions.
- Adjusting the bitrate and resolution in the bridge will also change the stream in the wyze app and vice versa.
- App equivalents would be:
  - 360p - SD30
  - SD - HD60 (HD120 for doorbell)
  - HD - HD120 (HD180 for doorbell)

### Custom FFmpeg Commands

You can pass a custom [command](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html) to FFmpeg by using `FFMPEG_CMD` in your docker-compose.yml:

#### For all cameras

```YAML
environment:
    ..
    - FFMPEG_CMD=-f h264 -i - -vcodec copy -f flv rtmp://rtsp-server:1935/{cam_name}
```

#### For a specific camera

where `CAM_NAME` is the camera name in UPPERCASE and `_` in place of spaces and hyphens:

```yaml
- FFMPEG_CMD_CAM_NAME=ffmpeg -f h264 -i - -vcodec copy -f flv rtmp://rtsp-server:1935/{cam_name}
```

üè† Home Assistant - Use `CAM_OPTIONS` and add a new entry for each camera:

```yaml
- CAM_NAME: Cam Name
  FFMPEG: ffmpeg -f h264 -i - -vcodec copy -f flv rtmp://rtsp-server:1935/{cam_name}
```

Additional info:

- The `ffmpeg` command is implied and is optional.
- The camera name is available as a variable `{cam_name}` for lowercase and `{CAM_NAME}` for uppercase.
- The audio pipe and format are available as the variable `{audio_in}`.

### Custom FFmpeg Flags

Custom ffmpeg flags can easily be tested with:

```YAML
environment:
    ..
    - FFMPEG_FLAGS=-fflags +flush_packets+genpts+discardcorrupt+nobuffer
```

or where `CAM_NAME` is the camera name in UPPERCASE and `_` in place of spaces and hyphens:

```yaml
- FFMPEG_FLAGS_CAM_NAME=-flags low_delay
```

### Rotate Video

NOTE: The bridge may require additional resuorces when rotation is enabled as the video has to be re-encoded.

- Rotate all doorbells:

  ```YAML
  environment:
      ..
      - ROTATE_DOOR=True
  ```

- Rotate other cameras 
  where `CAM_NAME` is the camera name in UPPERCASE and `_` in place of spaces and hyphens:

  Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise:

  ```YAML
  environment:
      ..
      - ROTATE_CAM_CAM_NAME=True
  ```

  Rotate video in other directions:

  ```YAML
      - ROTATE_CAM_OTHER_CAM=1 # 90 degrees clockwise.
      - ROTATE_CAM_THIRD_CAM=2 # 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
  ```

 Available options:
  `0` - Rotate by 90 degrees counter-clockwise and flip vertically.
  `1` - Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise. This is the default.
  `2` - Rotate by 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
  `3` - Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and flip vertically.

### rtsp-simple-server

[rtsp-simple-server](https://github.com/aler9/rtsp-simple-server/blob/main/rtsp-simple-server.yml) options can be customized as an environment variable in your docker-compose.yml by prefixing `RTSP_` to the UPPERCASE parameter.

e.g. use `- RTSP_RTSPADDRESS=:8555` to overwrite the default `rtspAddress`.

or `- RTSP_PATHS_ALL_READUSER=123` to customize a path specific option like `paths: all: readuser:123`

For camera specific options with spaces in the name of the camera (e.g. `Front Door`), be sure to replace the spaces with the `URI_SEPARATOR` which defaults to `-`.  So `Front Door` would be represented as `FRONT-DOOR`, and `paths: Front Door: runOnReady: ffmpeg...` could be set in your docker-compose as:

```yaml
environment:
  ...
  - RTSP_PATHS_FRONT-DOOR_RUNONREADY=ffmpeg...
```

- üè† For Home Assistant:
  Enter each customization into `RTSP_SIMPLE_SERVER`, e.g. use `paths_all_readusers=123` for `paths: all: readuser:123`.
